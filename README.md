# urcardboardheadset
Repository of arduino code for interactive Google Cardboard add-on for *ur cardboard pet* v2.0.

This is v3 of code for a headset previously shown at MCDA and HeK. A value from pressure sensors embedded in the silicone device is used to make the device "blush," pulse with a heartbeat, and warm by way of a peltier element.

More info on the project is available [here](http://marthahipley.com/ur-cardboard-pet-headset/).
